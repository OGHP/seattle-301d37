=======

**Song for the day: ["The Final Countdown" by Gabe The Dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn5vJ0dhxXs)**

- Reminder: the entrance exam for the 401 courses (which doubles as the final exam for this course) will be published late this afternoon and be available until 11:59pm Sunday. It is a graded portion of this course, regardless of your intent to advance to a 401 course.

- The exam is open-book, open-Google, open-Stack_Overflow, whatever resources you want to use. The exam is designed to be, in spots, a little bit beyond what has been covered. The intent in those spots is to measure resourcefulness and ability to adapt and figure something out. Give yourselves adequate time for the exam: 1-2 hours depending if you are fast or slow on these kinds of things.

## Project Ideas

- Ranking system
- Anime List based on user preferences (MAL API)
- Journal which lets you enter your daily entry and flavors it with Inspirational Quotes and Info (Numbers and Forismatic API)
- Public diary that shows entries from the current date from previous years from all users (interesting public experiment) ... what API?
  - Maybe a name/avatar generator?
  - Maybe use the mood api to generate that?
- Music mood mapper (spotify playlist)
- Halloween Costume Generator
- Carnival style (guess your age) quiz that could use APIs as the source of questions
- Connect to a brand's API (i.e. Marvel) and list auctions/items for sale
- Programming Project Templater / Tracker
- Twitter biggest stories of the day, perhaps categorized/filtered
  - (John) Maybe this could aggregate from multiple media sources and rank on frequency/popularity?
- QR Code Stickers for products you buy that link you to where you bought them.
  - (John) Great idea, but I'm sure I see the API angle ... unless it's for related items.
- DIRT FINDER
  - (John) This is the type of thing that could legit be on the app store for ($)
- Job Search tracker -- aggregate from multiple APIs the languages trending and pepper in reviews and salaries for the companies from Glassdoor.
